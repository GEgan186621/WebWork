# WebWork
Checks each site URL in your CSV to determine if it’s searchable for roles matching your criteria (Senior/Business Analyst, Data Insights, AI-related; Remote / Portland-based / U.S. remote).

Appends the result (“Yes” if searchable, “No” if not) into a new column called Connect.

Optionally, logs any searchable role examples into another column called ExampleRoles for quick reference.
